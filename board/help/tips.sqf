    "Construction: Objects constructed, that have been gained through perks, have a lifetime of 30 minutes before disappearing.",
    "Enemy Wrecks: Destroyed OPFOR attack aircraft have a 40% chance of producing an acquirable wreck. These can only produce an acquirable wreck one time. These wrecks have a lifetime of 45 minutes, and will disappear after this time if not rebuilt.",
    "Perks: Medkits are replenished at medical tents. Repair kits are replenished at vehicle service point structures (i.e. ammo point or ground vehicle service).",
    "Perks: One medkit & one repair kit can be given to other players, should they not have them. Medics have a perk that will let them give up to 2 medkits.",
    "Roles: Medics are able to heal other players, should they be injured. While this may seem obvious, this is the only class to have an inherent function.",
    "Vehicles: ATVs can tow certain aircraft.",
    "Wrecks: Only wrecks designated on the map can be lifted. Red wrecks (OPFOR) cannot be lifted without the respective perk. Wrecks without markers will eventually disappear."
