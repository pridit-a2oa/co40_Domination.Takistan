    "Construction: Objects constructed, that have been gained through perks, have a lifetime of 30 minutes before disappearing.",
    "Perks: Medkits are replenished at medical tents. Repair kits are replenished at vehicle service point structures (i.e. ammo point or ground vehicle service).",
    "Perks: One medkit & one repair kit can be given to other players, should they not have them.",
    "Roles: Medics are able to heal other players, should they be injured. While this may seem obvious, this is the only class to have an inherent function.",
    "Squads: Leaving any of the default squads puts you in a newly created squad. These created squads can only be joined by a context action on players within them.",
    "Vehicles: ATVs are capable of towing any aircraft.",
    "Wrecks: Only wrecks designated on the map can be rebuilt. Wrecks without markers can still be lifted, but can't be rebuilt and will eventually disappear."
