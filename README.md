**co40_Domination.Takistan** is an almost complete modular rewrite of the original Domination mission, which was created by **Xeno**, for [Arma 2: Operation Arrowhead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arma_2:_Operation_Arrowhead). This has been rebuilt from the ground up, with many new features and tweaks added in the process to provide a more enriching and immersive experience.

## Features
- Modular codebase with easy iteration and extensibility a core focal point.
- Main mission flow fundamentally altered resulting in an indefinite, and fluid cycle.
- Extensive perks system providing a deep and rewarding progression layer for players.
- Facility for players to construct OPFOR vehicles based on fulfilling research conditions.
- Expanded wreck system to include transitioning into a hangar once rebuilt & acquiring OPFOR wrecks.
- Anti-griefing measures such as disabled friendly fire, and building + vehicle invulnerability within the base area.

There are dozens more, mainly quality of life features. Some of these include the ability to tow aircraft, a basic inventory system in order to share medkits or repair kits in the field, increased danger with the introduction of roadside IEDs, a UAV that can be called in to provide support to ground troops by highlighting enemy activity, and **many** more.
